REVISION HISTORY
================

Version 1.7
-----------
* Why am I calling OpenSSL for random bytes when gpg can do this?
* This will be the first Github release. Wrote some documentation.
    
Version 1.6
-----------
* Added some command-line switches to make the script a little more
    user-friendly.

Version 1.5
-----------
* Added some fixes suggested by Christoph to avoid collision of
    messages when multiple UIDs on the same key had the same email
    address. Added the option to send mail messages out automatically.

Version 1.4
-----------
* First "release" of the script -- shared with Christoph
    Martin. This started out as a shell script I cobbled together to
    help me deal with the LISA 2013 Keysigning BoF.
